# SAMURAI BASED 8BIT PIXEL ART
[GR11 hackathon]

Hi! i tried little bit different style, since i used only 8 bits [which is the hardest] and made simple and unique characteristic for Daimyo.
there is presented 6 poses without unique items [helmet/sword/etc..] since it would not fit well in few bits like this.
my aim was to create some more unique style for your project to get easy recognised, so you can use it in ur marketing or soc. media. 

p.s. future edits can be done if any ideas like [colors/poses etc..]  hope you like it. sending good vibes (:
